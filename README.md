LEARN ANSIBLE:


Set Up Ansible Inventory File:
Create an inventory.ini file that lists all machines (IP addresses) you want to manage. Ansible uses this inventory to connect to the machines.
[servers]
172.XX.XX.XX1 ansible_user=your_user
172.XX.XX.XX2 ansible_user=your_user

Replace your_user with the username you'll use to connect to your machines.


Create Ansible Playbook:
Write an Ansible playbook (playbook.yml) to execute command.sh on each machine to gather system information.
---
- name: Gather system information
  hosts: servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Run command.sh to gather system information
      command: ./command.sh
      register: result

    - name: Save the system information to a file
      copy:
        content: "{{ result.stdout }}"
        dest: /tmp/system_info.txt



Prepare command.sh:
Ensure that your command.sh file is available on each target machine or modify the playbook to transfer command.sh to the target machines before executing it.


Ensure SSH Access:
Set up SSH access between the Ansible control node (e.g., your local machine or CI/CD runner) and target nodes. Ensure you have appropriate SSH keys configured.


Run Ansible Playbook:
Run the playbook using the following command:
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml


Create a GitHub Actions Workflow
If you want to automate this through GitHub Actions and download the resulting system information file locally, follow these steps:
GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a workflow file (ansible-gather-info.yml) in .github/workflows:

name: Gather and Store System Information

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  gather-info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Ansible
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y ansible openssh-client

    - name: Copy command.sh to each machine
      run: ansible all -i inventory.ini -u your_user -m copy -a "src=./command.sh dest=~/"

    - name: Run Ansible Playbook
      run: ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml

    - name: Download system_info.txt
      run: |
        scp -i /path/to/your/private_key your_user@TARGET_IP:/tmp/system_info.txt ./








Note:
Replace your_user with the appropriate SSH user name for your machines.
Replace /path/to/your/private_key with the path to your SSH private key.
Replace TARGET_IP with the specific IP from which you want to download system_info.txt.
Configure GitHub Secrets:

Store your SSH private key in GitHub secrets if you need to use it securely within the GitHub Actions environment.
Additional Considerations
Security: Ensure secure handling of SSH keys (e.g., use GitHub Secrets) and sensitive data.
Test Locally: Before automating with GitHub Actions, test the Ansible playbook and usage locally to verify functionality.
Permissions: Verify necessary permissions and configurations, like sudo privileges if required and installed dependencies on target machines.









Certainly! Preparing SSH Access is a crucial step for automating tasks with Ansible. This step involves ensuring that your Ansible control machine (where you execute the playbook) can securely and reliably connect to each target machine (both AWS EC2 instances and on-premise servers) via SSH.

Detailed Steps for Preparing SSH Access
Generate SSH Key Pair:

Generate an SSH key pair on your control machine if you don't already have one.
This consists of a private key (id_rsa) and a public key (id_rsa.pub).

    
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Press Enter to choose the default file location and provide a passphrase if desired.

Copy Public Key to Target Machines:

Transfer your public key (id_rsa.pub) to the .ssh/authorized_keys file on each target machine. This operation might require existing credentials or methods for initial access to the machines.
For AWS EC2 Instances:

Use the EC2 instance's public DNS or IP address if it's publicly accessible.

    
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ec2-user@<ec2_instance_ip>
ⓘ

Substitute ec2-user with the correct username for your EC2 instance, such as ubuntu for Ubuntu instances.

For On-Premise Servers:

Assuming a similar setup, use:

    
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub your_user@<on_prem_server_ip>
ⓘ

Again, replace your_user with the appropriate SSH user name for your server.

Verify SSH Access:

Test the SSH connection from your control machine to each target machine to ensure that key-based authentication is set up correctly.

    
ssh your_user@<target_machine_ip>
ⓘ
For code that is intended to be used in , the code generation features of our AI Services may only be used after prior approval of your responsible organizational unit.
You should be able to connect without being prompted for a password.

Configure SSH for Ansible:

Ensure that your SSH client configuration (usually found in ~/.ssh/config) optimizes the connection and specifies the correct key if needed. Here's an example entry:

    
Host *
  User your_user
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
ⓘ
For code that is intended to be used in , the code generation features of our AI Services may only be used after prior approval of your responsible organizational unit.
This configuration instructs SSH to use the specified identity file for all hosts. Modify the Host line to match specific patterns or IP addresses if further granularity is needed.
Handle Firewalls and Security Groups:

Ensure that the network security settings for your target machines allow incoming SSH traffic. For AWS EC2:

Update the security groups to allow inbound SSH (port 22) traffic from the IP address of your Ansible control machine.
For on-premise servers:

Ensure firewalls permit access to port 22 from the control machine's IP address.
Dealing with Network Restrictions:

If your environment involves private IP addresses or restricted networks, consider using VPNs, bastion hosts, or private connections that facilitate access between your Ansible control machine and the target machines.
Credential Management:

Securely manage SSH key pairs. Use tools like ssh-agent for handling private keys during active sessions, ensuring private keys are kept private and secure.
Final Checks
Ensure Consistency: Double-check user settings, authorized keys, and potential network obstructions across all machines.
Logging and Troubleshooting: Use verbose mode (-vvv) when running Ansible playbooks for detailed logging, aiding in stringently debugging potential connection issues.
By following these steps, you establish solid SSH connectivity, enabling Ansible to execute automated tasks across your network of machines seamlessly.
